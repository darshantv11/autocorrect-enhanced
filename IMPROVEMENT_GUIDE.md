# Autocorrection System Improvement Guide

## Current System Analysis

Your autocorrection system already has excellent foundations:
- ‚úÖ Large corpora (Brown + Reuters)
- ‚úÖ N-gram models (bigrams/trigrams)
- ‚úÖ Custom words and shortcuts
- ‚úÖ Context-aware suggestions
- ‚úÖ Grammar checking

## üöÄ Recommended Improvements

### 1. **Synonym Suggestions** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Priority: HIGH** - This will significantly improve user experience

#### Implementation:
```python
# Add WordNet integration for synonyms
from nltk.corpus import wordnet

def get_synonyms(self, word, max_synonyms=10):
    """Get synonyms using WordNet."""
    synonyms = set()
    synsets = wordnet.synsets(word.lower())
    
    for synset in synsets:
        for lemma in synset.lemmas():
            synonym = lemma.name().lower()
            if synonym != word.lower() and synonym in self.vocabulary:
                synonyms.add(synonym)
    
    return list(synonyms)[:max_synonyms]
```

#### Benefits:
- Users get alternative word suggestions
- Improves writing variety
- Context-aware synonym ranking

### 2. **Improved Edit Distance Algorithm** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Priority: HIGH** - Better accuracy for spelling corrections

#### Implementation:
```python
def advanced_edit_distance(self, word1, word2):
    """Advanced edit distance with character similarity."""
    # Character similarity weights
    char_similarity = {
        'aeiou': 0.8,  # Vowels are similar
        'bdpq': 0.9,   # Easily confused letters
        'mn': 0.9,
        'ij': 0.9,
        'uv': 0.9
    }
    
    distance = editdistance.eval(word1, word2)
    
    # Apply character similarity bonus
    similarity_bonus = 0
    for c1, c2 in zip(word1, word2):
        if c1 != c2:
            for similar_chars, sim_score in char_similarity.items():
                if c1 in similar_chars and c2 in similar_chars:
                    similarity_bonus += sim_score
                    break
    
    return distance - similarity_bonus * 0.3
```

#### Benefits:

    """Calculate importance scores for words."""
    self.word_importance = {}
    
    for word in self.vocabulary:
        # Base importance from frequency
        freq_importance = min(1.0, self.prob_of_word.get(word, 0) * 10000)
        
        # Length-based importance
        length_importance = 1.0 / (1 + len(word) * 0.1)
        
        # Context importance
        context_importance = 0
        if word in [bg[1] for bg in self.bigrams]:
            context_count = sum(1 for bg in self.bigrams if bg[1] == word)
            context_importance = min(1.0, context_count / 1000)
        
        self.word_importance[word] = freq_importance + length_importance + context_importance
```

#### Benefits:
- Better suggestion ranking
- Prioritizes common words
- Context-aware importance

### 4. **Collocation-Based Improvements** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Better context understanding

#### Implementation:
```python
def get_collocation_score(self, word1, word2):
    """Calculate collocation score between two words."""
    # Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
    p_word1 = self.prob_of_word.get(word1, 1e-9)
    p_word2 = self.prob_of_word.get(word2, 1e-9)
    p_bigram = self.prob_of_bigram.get((word1, word2), 1e-9)
    
    if p_bigram > 0:
        pmi = math.log(p_bigram / (p_word1 * p_word2))
        return max(0, pmi)
    return 0
```

#### Benefits:

    """Get suggestions that match the expected part of speech."""
    # Get POS of context
    if context_words:
        context_pos = pos_tag(context_words[-2:])
        expected_pos = self.predict_expected_pos(context_pos)
        
        # Filter suggestions by POS
        suggestions = self.get_basic_suggestions(word)
        pos_filtered = [s for s in suggestions if self.matches_pos(s, expected_pos)]
        
        return pos_filtered if pos_filtered else suggestions
    
    return self.get_basic_suggestions(word)
```

#### Benefits:
- Grammatically correct suggestions
- Better context understanding
- Reduced inappropriate suggestions

### 6. **User Learning and Adaptation** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

    """Record user behavior for learning."""
    if original_word not in self.user_patterns:
        self.user_patterns[original_word] = {}
    
    if selected_word not in self.user_patterns[original_word]:
        self.user_patterns[original_word][selected_word] = {
            'count': 0,
            'contexts': [],
            'last_used': time.time()
        }
    
    self.user_patterns[original_word][selected_word]['count'] += 1
    self.user_patterns[original_word][selected_word]['contexts'].append(context)
    self.user_patterns[original_word][selected_word]['last_used'] = time.time()
```

#### Benefits:
- Personalized suggestions

def detect_language(self, text):
    """Detect the language of the text."""
    # Use language detection library
    from langdetect import detect
    return detect(text)

def get_language_specific_suggestions(self, word, language):
    """Get suggestions specific to the detected language."""
    if language == 'en':
        return self.get_english_suggestions(word)

    """Get cached suggestions or compute new ones."""
    cache_key = f"{word}_{hash(tuple(context))}"
    
    if cache_key in self.suggestion_cache:
        return self.suggestion_cache[cache_key]
    
    suggestions = self.compute_suggestions(word, context)
    self.suggestion_cache[cache_key] = suggestions
    
    # Limit cache size
